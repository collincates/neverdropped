-Rename project to Neverdropped

-Ping...it works but how to notify when a post has been removed? Otherwise it just disappears with no explanation.

-Build out County, State, County, City names for passing along with PostObjects.

-set image datetime to orig cl posting datetime

-Set up recurring scraping. This is probably a matter of using datetime and running the thing at a certain time. Iâ€™m hesitant to remove the scrap delay at this point since it will be pulling a ton of info at once. We can cross than when we get to it.

-Getting it on Heroku.
