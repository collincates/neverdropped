-Implement desired metadata fields (send me a list if you have one in mind so I can attempt setting it up. Make, Model, etc.). Am also thinking it’s valuable to organize by location, too. Some like like ‘US/AZ/Phoenix’ or similar, that would be heirarchal.

-Set up recurring scraping. This is probably a matter of using datetime and running the thing at a certain time. I’m hesitant to remove the scrap delay at this point since it will be pulling a ton of info at once. We can cross than when we get to it.

-Getting it on Heroku. I sat down with someone at a meetup last night who introduced me to Heroku, so I can pick his brain more soon when the time comes to set this up.
